# Sample Agricultural Best Practices Guide

## Tomato Cultivation - Temperature Management

### Optimal Temperature Range
- **Ideal Range**: 21-27°C (70-80°F) during the day
- **Night Temperature**: 16-18°C (60-65°F)
- **Critical High Threshold**: Above 32°C (90°F) triggers heat stress
- **Critical Low Threshold**: Below 10°C (50°F) causes chilling injury

### Heat Stress Management (>32°C)
**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Ventilation**: Open all vents to maximum, activate exhaust fans
2. **Shading**: Deploy 30-50% shade cloth during peak hours (11am-3pm)
3. **Cooling**: Activate evaporative cooling systems (fog/mist)
4. **Irrigation**: Increase frequency to maintain plant turgor
5. **Monitoring**: Check plants every 2 hours for wilting symptoms

**Symptoms of Heat Stress:**
- Leaf curling and wilting
- Blossom drop (flowers fall before fruit set)
- Sunscald on fruits and leaves
- Reduced fruit size and quality

### Prevention Strategies
- Install automated temperature sensors with alerts
- Pre-cool greenhouse before morning temperature rise
- Use reflective mulch to reduce soil temperature
- Ensure adequate air circulation (fans every 15 meters)

## Soil Moisture Management

### Optimal Moisture Levels
- **Tomatoes**: 60-80% field capacity
- **Lettuce**: 70-85% field capacity  
- **Peppers**: 55-75% field capacity

### Critical Low Threshold: <40% Moisture
**Immediate Action Required:**
1. **Emergency Irrigation**: Apply water within 1 hour
2. **Check System**: Verify drip lines, emitters, valves
3. **Soil Test**: Measure actual moisture with probe
4. **Root Inspection**: Check for damage or disease

**Consequences of Low Moisture:**
- Blossom-end rot in tomatoes (calcium uptake failure)
- Reduced fruit size and yield
- Increased pest susceptibility
- Permanent root damage if prolonged

### Irrigation Best Practices
- Morning irrigation (6-9am) reduces disease risk
- Drip irrigation preferred over overhead (reduces leaf wetness)
- Monitor soil moisture at root zone depth (15-30cm)
- Adjust frequency based on plant growth stage

## CO2 Enrichment Guidelines

### Target Levels for Greenhouse Production
- **Ambient CO2**: 400 ppm (outdoor air)
- **Optimal Enrichment**: 800-1200 ppm during daylight hours
- **Maximum Safe Level**: 1500 ppm
- **Critical High**: >2000 ppm (toxicity risk)

### High CO2 Emergency (>1500 ppm)
**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Ventilate**: Open all vents, activate exhaust fans
2. **Stop Injection**: Turn off CO2 generators/burners
3. **Evacuate**: Remove workers from greenhouse if >3000 ppm
4. **Test**: Use CO2 meter to verify levels dropping
5. **Investigate**: Check for CO2 system malfunction

**Symptoms of CO2 Toxicity:**
- Headache and dizziness in workers
- Reduced plant growth (opposite of intended effect)
- Leaf chlorosis (yellowing)
- Increased disease susceptibility

### CO2 Injection Best Practices
- Inject only during daylight hours (when photosynthesis occurs)
- Stop injection 1 hour before sunset
- Monitor continuously with sensors
- Maintain proper ventilation to prevent excessive buildup
- Distribute CO2 evenly (multiple injection points)

## Humidity Control

### Optimal Relative Humidity
- **Vegetative Growth**: 70-80% RH
- **Flowering/Fruiting**: 60-70% RH
- **Critical High**: >85% RH (disease risk)
- **Critical Low**: <40% RH (transpiration stress)

### High Humidity Management (>85% RH)
**Actions to Reduce Humidity:**
1. Increase ventilation (exhaust fans + vents)
2. Activate heating system (warm air holds more moisture)
3. Reduce irrigation frequency
4. Increase plant spacing (improve air flow)
5. Apply preventive fungicides (powdery mildew, botrytis)

### Low Humidity Management (<40% RH)
**Actions to Increase Humidity:**
1. Reduce ventilation rate
2. Activate misting/fogging system
3. Apply shade cloth to reduce transpiration
4. Water paths/floors (evaporative cooling)
5. Increase irrigation frequency

## Light Management

### Optimal Light Levels (Photosynthetically Active Radiation)
- **Tomatoes**: 400-600 µmol/m²/s
- **Lettuce**: 200-300 µmol/m²/s
- **Peppers**: 300-500 µmol/m²/s

### Low Light Conditions (<100 lux for tomatoes)
**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Clean Glazing**: Remove dust, algae, shading from greenhouse roof
2. **Activate Supplemental Lighting**: Turn on LED/HPS grow lights
3. **Increase CO2**: Plants use less CO2 in low light, reduce injection
4. **Adjust Spacing**: Increase space between plants for better light penetration
5. **Prune**: Remove lower leaves to improve light distribution

**Consequences of Low Light:**
- Elongated stems (etiolation)
- Reduced fruit set and yield
- Poor fruit quality (low sugar content)
- Increased disease susceptibility

### High Light Management (>800 lux excess)
- Apply 30-50% shade cloth during summer months
- Use whitewash on greenhouse exterior
- Ensure adequate cooling to prevent heat stress

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Early Detection is Key
- **Daily Scouting**: Inspect 10% of plants daily
- **Sticky Traps**: Yellow cards for whiteflies, blue for thrips
- **Action Threshold**: Treat when 5% of plants show damage

### Biological Controls (Preferred First Line)
- **Aphids**: Release ladybugs or lacewings
- **Whiteflies**: Encarsia formosa parasitic wasps
- **Spider Mites**: Phytoseiulus persimilis predatory mites
- **Thrips**: Amblyseius cucumeris predatory mites

### Chemical Controls (Last Resort)
- Use only when biological controls fail
- Rotate modes of action to prevent resistance
- Follow pre-harvest interval (PHI) strictly
- Apply in evening to avoid harming beneficial insects

## Disease Prevention

### Environmental Controls
**Prevent Fungal Diseases:**
- Maintain humidity <80% RH
- Ensure good air circulation (fans)
- Avoid overhead irrigation
- Space plants adequately
- Remove infected plant material immediately

**Common Greenhouse Diseases:**
- **Powdery Mildew**: White powder on leaves, requires dry conditions + fungicide
- **Botrytis (Gray Mold)**: Fuzzy gray growth, thrives in high humidity + cool temps
- **Late Blight**: Brown lesions on leaves/stems, spreads rapidly in wet conditions
- **Root Rot**: Wilting despite adequate water, caused by overwatering + poor drainage

### Sanitation Protocols
- Disinfect tools between plants (10% bleach solution)
- Remove plant debris daily
- Clean floors and walkways weekly
- Disinfect greenhouse between crops (sulfur fumigation or steam)

## Emergency Response Protocols

### Temperature Alert (>35°C or <5°C)
1. **Immediate**: Adjust climate control systems
2. **Within 30 min**: Verify all plants for stress symptoms
3. **Within 1 hour**: Implement corrective actions
4. **Within 4 hours**: Re-check and document incident

### Moisture Alert (<30% or >90%)
1. **Immediate**: Check irrigation system functionality
2. **Within 15 min**: Begin corrective irrigation or drainage
3. **Within 1 hour**: Soil probe verification
4. **Daily**: Monitor affected plants for 7 days

### CO2 Alert (>1800 ppm)
1. **Immediate**: Evacuate personnel, open all vents
2. **Within 5 min**: Shut down CO2 system
3. **Within 30 min**: CO2 levels must return to <800 ppm
4. **Before re-entry**: Test air quality with meter
